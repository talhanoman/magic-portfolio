## Overview

Eeko.ai is a creative content platform designed to help businesses and creators produce visually appealing, on-brand social media posts effortlessly—directly via WhatsApp or a web-based editor.

## Key Features

- **AI Image Generation**: Users can upload photos and automatically generate branded visuals using AI-generated templates and design enhancements.
- **Canva-like Editor**: Interactive web editor for customizing layouts, colors, and text overlays in a responsive environment.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: One-click delivery of finished designs over WhatsApp for quick sharing.
- **Template Library**: Access to thousands of ready-made templates for various business styles (e.g., restaurants, boutiques, service providers).
- **Auto-Branding**: Visual styles are auto-matched to users’ brands via color and theme detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, translating Figma to pixel-perfect UI.
- **AI Integration**: Leveraged **OpenAI** for content suggestions and used a custom API to generate visuals.
- **State Management**: Implemented React state hooks and context for seamless user interactions.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on **Vercel**, with CI/CD setup for rapid updates.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was ensuring the editor remained smooth and performant across devices while integrating AI-generated visuals in real time. We solved this by optimizing component rendering and adopting lazy-loading strategies. Another focus was translating Figma designs into modular, reusable UI components.

## Outcome

Eeko.ai has been widely adopted by small businesses to streamline their social media content creation. The app's ease of use—especially the WhatsApp sharing feature—and polished UI have led to significant adoption and user satisfaction.
