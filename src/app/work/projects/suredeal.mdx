## Overview

Suredeal.io is a web-based quoting tool that empowers businesses with professional, interactive quotations. Customers can view, upsell, and accept quotes seamlessly—while sales teams track engagement and automate follow-ups to close more deals.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Quotations**: Customers view and accept quotes on any device, with optional upsell items addable before purchase.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provides stats on quote views, interactions, and acceptance rates—helping businesses optimize their sales approach.
- **Automated Reminders**: Sends follow-up reminders automatically, reducing lost opportunities.
- **Responsive UI**: Works smoothly across devices while remaining easy to update and maintain.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React with traditional CSS (chosen for easy maintenance by the client).
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for efficient API integration and real-time updates.
- **Backend**: Python Django handling data models, authentication, and business logic.
- **Payments**: Paddle integration to manage subscriptions and transactions.
- **Notifications & APIs**: Cloud/backend logic for quote tracking and automated reminders.

## Challenges and Learnings

We opted for a classic CSS setup so clients could manage styles without a complex stack—this streamlined handoffs and empowered their team. The real challenge was ensuring smooth developer UX while maintaining maintainability for non-developers. We balanced declarative TanStack data fetching with Django’s API backend, enabling responsive updates without overhead. Integrating Paddle securely for quotes and subscriptions also required attention to webhook security and state consistency.

## Outcome

Suredeal empowers sales teams to send polished quotes, boost upsell opportunities, and close deals more efficiently. With insights on customer engagement and automated follow-ups, clients saw improved conversion rates—all within a platform that’s easy to customize and maintain.
